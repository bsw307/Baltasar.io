# El pueblo unido: Images from the protests in Chile

In October, Chile saw its largest riots since the end of the military dictatorship 30 years ago. As the military once again descended upon Santiago, and martial law was established, the people spoke in unison - demanding reforms in the healthcare, education and pension systems. But beyond the pragmatic policy changes, they called for a sense of dignity and justice in their society. Chile has long been praised for the neo-liberal reforms assumed under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, as they have let the country develop a relatively stable and successful economy. But, as the prosperity of the country has not been reflected in the lives of the working or middle class (see inequality of wealth and income distribution; class mobility; access to education), the underlying systems are being questioned.

I am currently writing a longer piece on the subject, but in the meantime I've uploaded the pictures I took during my time with the protests.
