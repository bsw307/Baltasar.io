# Generating Hilbert curves

## What?

Hilbert curves are fascinating, space-filling fractals. That means that they can be used to map from 2D to 1D spaces, while preserving nearness. That means that, if two points are close to each other in 2D space, they will be close to each other on the resulting 1D space as well. This gives Hilbert curves immense usefullness in many areas, such as image processing. 

## Why?

This project was mostly inspired by the technical challenge of drawing Hilbert curves.
